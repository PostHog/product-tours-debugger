# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

**What is a changeset?** A changeset is a piece of information about changes made in a branch or commit. It
holds three bits of information:
- What we need to release
- What version we are releasing packages at (using a [semver bump type](https://semver.org/))
- A changelog entry for the released packages
